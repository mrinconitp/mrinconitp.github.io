  <h1>Welcome to Michael's Quick Biography </h>
    <p> Welcome to my information page. My name is Michael Rincon and I am a junior at the University of Rhode Island. I am an accounting major with an undeclared minor. Outside of the class room I enjoy dominating in the pool as much as in the field. I hope the topics I learn in accounting and computer science will allow me to find a job I enjoy doing.</p>
